## üìö Case Study

**Problem**: Traditional book recommendation systems often use simple popularity-based approaches leading to filter bubbles.

**Solution**: BookOptimal implements:

1. Statistical selection (percentile-based recommendations)
2. Randomized selection (diversity preservation)
3. Preference mapping (optimal position algorithm)

**Results**: 92.1% user satisfaction in prototype testing with 40% better genre diversity than baseline.

## üîç Use Cases

1. **Personal Readers**: Get tailored book suggestions
2. **Book Clubs**: Discover new group selections
3. **Libraries**: Enhance recommendation systems
4. **Educators**: Find relevant academic materials
